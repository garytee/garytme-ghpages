# People of the American Outdoors

## About the company
Tolin Hessell has been travelling across the country in his van to explore beautiful areas and to meet interesting, like-minded people. He started asking these individuals what inspires them to get outside and what they love about the outdoors. People of the American Outdoors was created to showcase these adventurers, nomads, and travelers, and to share their passion of an outdoor lifestyle.

## Case Study
Tolin had already been successful on Etsy selling various products such as shirts, tote bags, and art. He had recently started travelling the country in his van and wanted to share with the world some of his adventures and the people he's met along the way.
