# Red Mango

## About the company
Red Mango first opened in 2007, and today, there are over 200 locations domestically, in Mexico and in Central America, and yes, every spoonful is still as good as the first. Every single location is locally owned. Red Mango support the local communities in which we are located and provide more than just yummy and better-for-you treats!

## Case Study

Red Mango needed a website to promote its redmango4life sweepstakes. 

## What I did
- Created a website that allows users to upload pictures at a chance to win Red Mango for life
- Linked photos from Twitter with a specific hashtag to also appear on the site.
- Curate content to keep unwanted material from appearing on the website.

## Libraries / Tools
- Twitter API
