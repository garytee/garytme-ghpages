# 12 Oaks Desserts

## About the company
The philosophy that drives 12 Oaks Desserts is that a great dessert makes life a bit sweeter. The seed was planted many years ago in a tiny Manhattan apartment by two best friends with a passion for dessert and a devotion to watching Gone with the Wind at least several times a year.

Now based in Los Angeles, 12 Oaks Desserts bring time-honored baking traditions to modern treats. The result? Cakes you’ll crave, cheesecakes you’ll covet, and cake pops that make your busy life just a little more delicious.
