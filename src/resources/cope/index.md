# COPE (Centers of Psychiatric Excellence)

## About the company
COPE (Centers of Psychiatric Excellence) is a management services organization that offers administrative and advisory support to independently operated psychiatric treatment clinics.  COPE is proud to partner with highly specialized clinics around the country that service the most difficult to treat cases of depression, anxiety (specifically PTSD), and opioid dependence. 

## Case Study
COPE needed a website for patients to learn about treatment for illnesses such as depression and PTSD as well as allow patients to find locations and purchase treatments.

## What I did
- Developed a multi site website with a flexible CMS to allow easy customization for each COPE location
- Create a shop for location owners to manage patient payments

## Libraries / Tools
- Wordpress MultiSite
- AJAX
- Stripe API
- Google Maps API
