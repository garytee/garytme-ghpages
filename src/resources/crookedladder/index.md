# Crooked Ladder Brewery

## About the company
The Crooked Ladder Brewing Company is a joint venture between three good friends (two brothers) with diverse backgrounds and experience. David Wirth, President is a private, east end contractor who designed and built the microbrewery and tasting room. His brother Steven Wirth, Sales Director is also owner of Digger's Ales N' Eats Pub and Restaurant, located right next door and Duffy Griffiths, Head Brewer is also the owner of two Duffy's Delis and the Fire Department Chief of Jamesport.

## Case Study

Crooked Ladder was looking to showcase it's range of beverages with an interactive menu above the bar.

## What I did
- Developed an interactive menu powered by a Raspberry Pi connected to the TV. 
- In addition to the beer menu, patrons could have their pictures show up on the tv by using a specific hashtag on instagram.

## Libraries / Tools
- Raspberry Pi
