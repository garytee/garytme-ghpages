The oldest printer I own is still going strong, however, it doesn’t have WiFi so I can’t print wirelessly. Rather than buy another printer that will inevitably fail, I figured I would be better served if I could just make my old printer work wirelessly. All I would need is a Raspberry Pi Zero W ($10) and I could easily remedy this. </p>\n<h2>Step 1: Install Raspbian OS</h2>\n<p>The first step in any Raspberry Pi project is to install an Operating System. There are several ways to do this, but I recommend using the ApplePiBaker method from my article <a href=\"https://www.garyt.me/posts/installing-an-os-on-your-pi/\">here</a>. </p>\n<h2>Step 2: Install CUPS</h2>\n<p>CUPS is an open source printing system developed by Apple that supports printing to both local and network printers. After installing Raspbian on your Pi, run this command to install CUPS:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"hljs-js\"><code class=\"hljs-js\">sudo apt<span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token keyword\">get</span> install cups</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once that’s installed, you’ll need to give administrative rights to the user “pi”. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Make Any Old Printer Wireless","path":"/posts/making-a-dumb-printer-smart/","images":["images/3.png"],"heroimages":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.7797202797202798,"src":"/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/3c17d/3.png","srcSet":"/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/e0491/3.png 180w,\n/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/f4094/3.png 360w,\n/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/3c17d/3.png 720w,\n/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/64c42/3.png 1018w","srcWebp":"/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/2aa8d/3.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/1a890/3.webp 180w,\n/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/b6bb8/3.webp 360w,\n/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/2aa8d/3.webp 720w,\n/static/954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23/d7d05/3.webp 1018w","sizes":"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"}},"publicURL":"/static/3-954e0568579849293bfd158d6c198c23.png"}],"category":"Raspberry-Pi","tags":["tag"],"date":"2018-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","components":null,"tweets":null,"summary":"Add a wireless connection to your old printer with the help of a Raspberry Pi"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
